        <p>
                I am a Master's in computer science student at the University of Minnesota,
                currently assisting Dr. Chih Lin Chi as a graduate research assistant.
                I am passionate about building and deploying machine learning models that solve real-world problems. 
        </p>

        <p>
                I am working towards a research thesis on generative models that understand and 
                generate appropriate social signals during a conversation by observing other conversation partners.
                I am also working on models to predict patient's drug adherence,
                 based on their history of prescription drug use. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
                I am always passionately looking to apply my skills and craft efficient machine learning solutions
                to real-world problems spanning a wide range of topics including Computer Vision, 
                Personalized Health Care, and More.
